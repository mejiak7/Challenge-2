# Challenge-2

# Description
For Challenge-2 I was asked to create Portfolio web application from scratch. 

This web application is my very own portfolio, where I can showcase all that I have learned so far. It was made with so much love and dedication so everything about this web application means alot to me.

Its portfolio where a potential employer can review samples of pervious projects that I've worked on. 

My motivation was to give it an early 2000's myspace profile type of vibe, inspired by what sparked my intrest in this field.

# Layout
I created a header with Navigation elements that allows you to navigate throughout the web application.

In this Portfolio I created 4 sections:

About Me
Projects
Resume
Contact Me

# About Me
In this section I displayed a picture of myself along with a small bio and a couple of pictures that showcase who I am and what I love to do.

# Projects
In this section I displayed some projects I've worked on, and added some placeholders for future projects.

# Resume
In this section I am showcasing my most recent eperiences 

# Contact
In this section I added some information regarding the best way to contact me.
